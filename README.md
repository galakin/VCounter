(V stand for vendemmia)

Hi, this is my new freshly Flutter project aimed to create a user friendly bugless and shiny Magic: the gathering life counter with the possibility of create a new game, see the old games, create a new tournament, and see the result of the old turnament.
The GUI is mainly writte in italian (my native language), but i hope to translate it back in english as soon as possibile.
Feel free to clone this project and write some criticism about how unpleasent my code is.

Now the only impemented features are:
- simple life counter for 1v1 games with a temporary counter for the next change on life
- poison counter 
- commander damage counter
- local db with latest played games

The working progress features are:
- Personalized middle screen menu
- Chronological ordered old games
- Experience and energy counter
- Local games saved on firebase's firestore db

A logical scheme af the app's route can be found at https://whimsical.com/L1jCkcVQNrxUP5zSeyNvw9, bear in mind that this is just a scheme that i use to visualize the logical app's navigation route, significant change can occur between it and the app's code
